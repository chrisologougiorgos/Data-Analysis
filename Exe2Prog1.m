%%%%%%%%%  Compare Resampling with Parametric X^2 for Exponential %%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%  distribution (Coil EIGHT and ROUND)                    %%%%%%%%%


% Load the data from 'TMS.xlsx'
data = readtable('TMS.xlsx');

% Access the second column (EDduration)
ed_duration = data.EDduration;

% Choose data of EDduration with Coil EIGHT(1) and ROUND(0)
ed_tms_eight = ed_duration(strcmp(data.CoilCode, '1'));
ed_tms_round = ed_duration(strcmp(data.CoilCode, '0'));

% Parameter Î» of the Exponential distribution for each sample
lambda_eight = 1/mean(ed_tms_eight);
lambda_round = 1/mean(ed_tms_round);

% Goodness-Fit test with data of EDduration with Coil EIGHT and ROUND
[chi2_eight, chi2_rsmpl_eight] = Group44Exe2Fun1(ed_tms_eight, lambda_eight);
[chi2_round, chi2_rsmpl_round] = Group44Exe2Fun1(ed_tms_round, lambda_round);

% Descisions of Goodness-Fit test
p_value_eight = mean(chi2_rsmpl_eight >= chi2_eight);
p_value_round = mean(chi2_rsmpl_round >= chi2_round);

                    %%%%%%%%%% COMMENTS %%%%%%%%%%

% -The RESAMPLING test shows that the data DON'T fit the Exponential 
%  distribution well, because x^2 of the initial sample is in the right 
%  tail and the null hypothesis is rejected (p-value < 0.05).
%
% -The PARAMETRIC test, indicates that the x^2 of the initial sample is 
%  not in the right tail, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis 
%  (p-value > 0.05) and we accept that the data fit the Exponential dist.
